## What is it?

### This application is basically a key logger, thats saves keyboard as well as mouse inputs (movements included).
---


## How does it work?

### The program saves the inputs inside a json, which can be read and 'played' again later.
---

## How to use?

### Choose between record (1) and play (2)

| Record inputs | 'Play' a file |
|---|---|
| 1:Choose a file name (no extension needed)<br>2:Press **__F1__** to start recording, **__F2__** to pause/stop and **__F3__** to quit. | 1:Choose the name of the file to read (no extension needed) <br>2:Press **__F1__** to start 'playing' the file|

>[!WARNING]
>Exiting the application without saving (F2 and F3 save the inputs, saving is not done in real time at the moment) will result in data loss.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>All json files will be created and have to be in the SavedDataFiles folder to be found. (The folder is created automatically)
